function [outputArg1,outputArg2] = mps2channel(fa_ch, fb_ch, fa_mp, fb_mp)
% allocate source signal(s) to frequency channel
% input:
%   fa_ch ... lower frequency limit of channel (Hz)
%   fb_ch ... upper frequency limit of channel (Hz)
%   fa_mp ... vector of lower frequency limits of source signals (Hz)
%   fb_mp ... vector of upper frequency limits of source signals (Hz)
